# ABOUT 4LIFECAFE
4LifeCafe is a fictional local coffee shop located in Nebraska, created for a portfolio project combining marketing, business analysis, and SQL. The café is situated near a college and a business district, attracting a mix of student and non-student customers.

This project simulates a real-world scenario where I take on the role of a business analyst using SQL to help the café's leadership team answer key questions about product performance, customer behavior, and revenue trends.
